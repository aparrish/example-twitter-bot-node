This bot uses [RiTaJS](https://rednoise.org/rita/index.php) to implement a very
simple Twitter chatbot, operating over direct messages.

After installing the packages from `package.json` with `npm install`, run this
script like so:

    node bot.js APP_KEY APP_SECRET ACCESS_TOKEN TOKEN_SECRET SCREEN_NAME

... replacing `APP_KEY` with your application key, `APP_SECRET` with your
application secret, `ACCESS_TOKEN` with your bot's access token, `TOKEN_SECRET`
with your bot's access token secret and `SCREEN_NAME` with your bot's
screen name.
