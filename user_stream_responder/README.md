This bot is intended to demonstrate how to listen to the user stream and react
to incoming events. As it stands, this bot is not a very good citizen and would
probably get banned quickly if ever put into production use. [Consult the
guiding
principles](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/agreement-and-policy#i-guiding-principles)
for more information.

After installing the packages from `package.json` with `npm install`, run this
script like so:

    node bot.js APP_KEY APP_SECRET ACCESS_TOKEN TOKEN_SECRET SCREEN_NAME

... replacing `APP_KEY` with your application key, `APP_SECRET` with your
application secret, `ACCESS_TOKEN` with your bot's access token, `TOKEN_SECRET`
with your bot's access token secret and `SCREEN_NAME` with your bot's
screen name.
